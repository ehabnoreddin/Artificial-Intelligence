Questions
=========

	1) Why do you believes your h3 heuristic function is admissible? 

	I believe a heuristic function can be admissible if it does not over
	estimate the cost. This can be done by simplifying the problem and
	making sure you never over estimate in that scenario. Then in more
	complex scenarios you will theoretically never over estimate. I believe
	my h3 function satisfies this requirement.

	2) What parts of the assignment did you find difficult?

	The heuristic functions were quite difficult to formulate. There are
	many possibilities to try and determining one I liked was hard. I also
	had to make sure the function was admissible which added to the 
	complexity. Gaining confidence in the function was also a hard part of
	the assignment.
