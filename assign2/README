1) Describe which parts of the assignment you felt were difficult.

I felt the most difficult part of the assignment was understanding and
implementing the iterative deepening search algorithm. The puzzles were not
very difficult to implment. The additional functions were pretty easy to
implement as well.

The part of the assignment that gave me trouble as the search algorithm
itself.
