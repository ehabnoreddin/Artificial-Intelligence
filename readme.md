CS440
=====

A collection of assignments I completed for Colorado State University's CS440 (Artificial Intelligence) class. I don't condone cheating. I kept this repository
private during the semester. I only opened it up when the class was completed.
If you're in a new semester and stumbled onto this please feel free to use it to
learn but don't copy code!


Dependencies
====

`python` version 2.6 or greater, may work on Python 3; I'm hopeful.
