Questions
=========

	1) Describe any problems you ran into..
    
    The display function was hard to work out. It was a lot of data all 
    jumbled around and organizing it in a neat way was quite involved.
    
    In addition, I had trouble sorting out part 2 of the problem. I didn't
    decrement the loop counter. Instead, I just tried to count the number of
    preferences in the solution and took the solution with the highest number
    of preferences.
    
    I had a hard time figuring out the variable-domains-neighbors for this
    problem. I kept getting strange results. I didn't find any useful resources
    online or in the book.
