	1) Describe any problems you ran into..
    
    I ran into a number of issues... matplot lib didn't work at all on my
    system (Mac OSX). I wish it did-- it worked on my work machine but not on
    my home machine (big problem!). I commented out the plotting code while I 
    worked.
    
    I had a difficult time finding how to calculate the list of possible moves
    at a given state. I tried to create a map of valid transitions but it 
    became unrulely quick and ended up producing infinite loops etc. It took
    me a while to track down all the possible transitions... I think I got them
    all. It seems to work well-- it learns and produces faster paths as it 
    plays many games. Works well after 10,000. I wish I had the plotting up and
    working so I could see the results.
