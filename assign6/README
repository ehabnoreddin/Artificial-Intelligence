Questions
=========

	1) Describe any problems you ran into..
    
    The display function was hard to work out. It was a lot of data all 
    jumbled around and organizing it in a neat way was quite involved.
    
    In addition, I had trouble sorting out part 2 of the problem. I didn't
    decrement the loop counter. Instead, I just tried to count the number of
    preferences in the solution and took the solution with the highest number
    of preferences. It's difficult to see because there isn't a lot of room
    for the classes to move around in the schedule, but you can see the number
    of steps usually goes up a lot while searching for preferences because it 
    needs to search a lot more usually. You can also notice cs160 and cs161 
    usually always end up at 1pm or 2pm which is a preference. The others are
    a little harder to see.
    
    I had a hard time figuring out the variable-domains-neighbors for this
    problem. I kept getting strange results. I did find the author's definition
    of the variables-domains-neighbors to be helpful.
