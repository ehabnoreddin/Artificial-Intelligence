Questions
=========

	1) Discuss any difficulties with the assignment and list useful links.
        
	I found the assignment to be fairly straight forward. I did find alpha
	beta prunning to be a little difficult. I found Wikipedia to be
	helpful when trying to learn more about it.
	
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning
	
	I also had concerns when implementing IDS within the search. I did find
	the authors link to be fairly useful when scanning code.
	
	http://code.google.com/p/aima-python/
        
        2) Discuss the number of moves and the EBF for the two games.
	
	The EBF was a little odd to me-- I couldn't find any way to truly measure
	the depth for each algorithm. I assumed the depth was the same as nodes
	expanded (moves checked). This resulted in fairly high EBFs and approached
	1.0 quickly. I ended up using the number of turns to represent the depth and
	I used the number of total moves as the nodes.
	
	I used a less accurate EBF function but its calculation was quicker. I
	would have gotten better accuracy with another EBF function. I also
	believe having some guidelines as to measure depth would have made it
	a little easier to calculate. I decided on using player turns as my depth.
	This made sense to me because it demonstrated the depth it took to find the
	"solution" (winning).
	
  
Notes:
======

I completed the extra credit problem (average wins agains 100 games agains a
random opponent). The function is commented out by default (I assume you don't want
to wait for it to finish when checking HW. You can uncomment it if you want to
check it).
