Questions
=========

	1) Why do you believes your h3 heuristic function is admissible? 

	I believe a heuristic function can be admissible if it does not over
	estimate the cost. This can be done by simplifying the problem and
	making sure you never over estimate in that scenario. Then in more
	complex scenarios you will theoretically never over estimate. I believe
	my h3 function satisfies this requirement.

	2) What parts of the assignment did you find difficult?

	The EBF function was difficult for me. I couldn't follow the example notes,
	so I searched the web. I did find a very quick and easy method for calculating
	EBF. You simply calculate n**1/d
	
	It's close and calculation is fast. I know it's not the exact, but it was the
	best I could do.
